# TODO List 
A simple TODO list app that allows users to add items to their TODO list as well as update and delete them.


## Installation
1. Clone the codebase to your local computer.
2. Install `Expo` by running `npm install -g expo`
3. Install `Expo CLI` globally by running `npm install -g expo-cli`
4. Navigate to the app repository and run `npm install` to download all dependencies
5. run `npx expo start` to start the app.

Once the app is started, you can use multiple options to open the app. The terminal should show a QR code such as the following:

The easiest option is to download the `Expo Go` app from the playstore/apple store and scan the QR code to immediately start using the app from your mobile device. You can also use an emulator to open the app. Please follow the instructions on the terminal to open the app on the emulator. 
** Note **: Regardless of using an emulator or an actual mobile device, you should be able to see all logs on the console. 

The app has a login screen. Since it does not have an actual user, the app uses a hardcoded value for username and password. To pass the login screen, use the following credentials:

Username: admin

Password: test123
